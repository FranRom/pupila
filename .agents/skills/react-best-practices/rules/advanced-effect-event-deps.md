## Do Not Put Effect Events in Dependency Arrays

Effect Event functions have no stable identity — identity changes every render. Don't include `useEffectEvent` return in `useEffect` deps. Keep reactive values as deps; call Effect Event from effect body or subscriptions created by it.

**Incorrect (Effect Event added as dep):**

```tsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react'

function ChatRoom({ roomId, onConnected }: {
  roomId: string
  onConnected: () => void
}) {
  const handleConnected = useEffectEvent(onConnected)

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId)
    connection.on('connected', handleConnected)
    connection.connect()

    return () => connection.disconnect()
  }, [roomId, handleConnected])
}
```

Effect Event in deps = effect re-runs every render + triggers React Hooks lint rule.

**Correct (depend on reactive values, not Effect Event):**

```tsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react'

function ChatRoom({ roomId, onConnected }: {
  roomId: string
  onConnected: () => void
}) {
  const handleConnected = useEffectEvent(onConnected)

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId)
    connection.on('connected', handleConnected)
    connection.connect()

    return () => connection.disconnect()
  }, [roomId])
}
```
