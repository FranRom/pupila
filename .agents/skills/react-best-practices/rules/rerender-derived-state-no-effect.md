## Calculate Derived State During Rendering

Value computable from current props/state → don't store in state or update in effect. Derive during render → avoids extra renders + state drift. Don't set state in effects solely in response to prop changes; prefer derived values or keyed resets.

**Incorrect (redundant state + effect):**

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('First')
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Last')
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + ' ' + lastName)
  }, [firstName, lastName])

  return <p>{fullName}</p>
}
```

**Correct (derive during render):**

```tsx
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('First')
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Last')
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

  return <p>{fullName}</p>
}
```
