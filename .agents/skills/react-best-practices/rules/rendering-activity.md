## Use Activity Component for Show/Hide

`<Activity>` preserves state/DOM for expensive components that toggle visibility often.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { Activity } from 'react'

function Dropdown({ isOpen }: Props) {
  return (
    <Activity mode={isOpen ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
      <ExpensiveMenu />
    </Activity>
  )
}
```

Avoids expensive re-renders + state loss.
